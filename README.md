Author: James Ivancic

Description
Logo Generator CLI is a Node.js command-line application that allows freelance web developers to quickly generate simple logos for their projects without the need to hire a graphic designer. The application prompts the user to input the desired logo text, text color, shape, and shape color. It then generates an SVG file of the logo according to the provided inputs.
